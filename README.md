This project aims to detect cervical cancer at an early stage by applying both machine learning and deep learning techniques on structured data and medical images. The first part of the project focuses on a cervical cancer risk factor dataset, where key preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical features were performed to prepare the data for modeling. Multiple machine learning classification algorithms were evaluated, and through hyperparameter tuning, the best model achieved an accuracy of 96.4%. In the second part of the project, image-based diagnosis was carried out using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Transfer learning with pre-trained models was applied on Pap smear slide images, with additional image augmentation techniques like rotation and zooming used to improve model generalization. This CNN-based approach reached an accuracy of 96%. Both models were assessed using performance metrics such as precision, recall, and confusion matrix. These complementary approaches demonstrate strong potential for improving early detection and clinical decision-making in cervical cancer screening.
